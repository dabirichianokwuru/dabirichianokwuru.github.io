              Hi there! welcome to my website, my name is Dabirichi Blaise
              Anokwuru and I am a quantitatively driven Computer Science student
              at Portland State University. I am passionate about learning and
              leveraging technology to solve real world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently I work as an IT Support Technician at the Office of
              Information Technology at PSU and also as a Communications
              Assistant at Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science. I
              combine both technical expertise with strong communication skills
              to bridge the gap between complex technical concepts and practical
              solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              With my experience with Linux systems, and programming languages
              such as C, C++ and Python and tools like Git, Visual Studio, Jira,
              I am constantly seeking opportunities to apply my skills in
              software development and technical problem solving.
